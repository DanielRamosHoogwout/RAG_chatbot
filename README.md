# RAG_chatbot
 AI chatbot using RAG techniques

 This project is about a chatbot enhanced with RAG
 Using: Python, LangChain, ChromaDB, ChatGPT
 Hopefully I will be able to improve the model with RAG techniques such as decoupling, replacing queries with embedded, hypothetical documents...

 Finally this chatbot should be implemented in my website, so users can interact with it to answer simple questions relating to my business which luckily is AI, ML and analytics.

 Hopefully I am not the only one reading this.
